        <h1>Web 3.0 the new emerging technology</h1>
        <p> 07 JAn || 6 min read</p>
        <p style="margin-top:28px ;">
            Web 3.0 (Web3) is the third generation of the evolution 
            of web technologies. The web, also known as the World Wide Web,
             is the foundational  layer for how the internet is used,
            providing website and application services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 is still evolving and being defined, and as such, there isn't a canonical,
             universally accepted definition. What is clear, though, is that Web 3.0 will have a strong emphasis 
             on decentralized applications and make extensive use of blockchain-based technologies.
              Web 3.0 will also make use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help 
            empower more intelligent and adaptive applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took over 10 years to transition from the original web, Web 1.0, to Web 2.0, and it is expected to take just as long, if not longer, to fully implement and reshape the web with Web 3.0.

If the trend of change is traced from Web 1.0, a static information provider where people read websites but rarely interacted with them, to Web 2.0, an interactive and social web enabling collaboration between users, then it can be assumed that 
Web 3.0 will change both how websites are made and how people interact with them.
        </p><br>
       <h2>How does Web 3.0 work?</h2><br>
       <p>
        Many websites and nearly all applications in the Web 2.0 era rely on some form of centralized database 
        to deliver data and help to enable functionality. With Web 3.0, instead of a centralized database, 
        applications and services make use of a decentralized blockchain. With blockchain, the basic i
        dea is that there isn't an arbitrary central authority, but rather a form of distributed consensus.</p>
<p>
An emerging governance ideal within the blockchain and Web 3.0 community is the concept of a decentralized 
autonomous organization (DAO). Instead of having a central authority that governs the operations of a platf
orm, with a DAO, Web 3.0 technologies and communities provide a form of self-governance in an attempted decentralized approach.</p>
<p>
Web 3.0 also fundamentally works with cryptocurrency, more so than with fiat currency. 
Finance and the ability to pay for goods and services with a decentralized form of payment
 is enabled across Web 3.0 with the use of cryptocurrencies, which are all built and enabled on top of blockchain technology.

Both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 were primarily built with the IPv4 addressing space. As a function of a massive growth of the web over the decades, there is a need in Web 3.0 for more internet addresses, which is what IPv6 provides.
