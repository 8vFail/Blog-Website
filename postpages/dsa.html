            An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. It is a step-by-step procedure,
            which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.
          <br><h3>Every computer science student is expected to know the following algorithms:</h3>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>1.Binary Search</h2>
        <p>
            Binary search which is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. Like all divide-and-conquer algorithms, 
            binary search first divides a large array into two smaller subarrays and then recursively (or iteratively) operate the subarrays.
             But instead of working on both subarrays, it discards one subarray and continues on the second subarray.
             This decision of discarding one subarray is made in just one comparison hence decreasing size of array by two each time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>2.Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
        <p>
            Breadth–first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, 
            sometimes referred to as a ‘search key’) and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next-level neighbors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>3.Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
        <p>
            Depth–first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts 
            at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root for a graph) and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>4.Dijkstra’s Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            Given a source vertex s from a set of vertices V in a weighted digraph where all its edge weights w(u, v) are non-negative,
             find the shortest path weights d(s, v) from source s for all vertices v present in the graph.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>5.Kadane’s Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            The idea is to maintain a maximum (positive-sum) subarray “ending” at each index of the given array. 
            This subarray is either empty (in which case its sum is zero) or consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous index.
