        <h1>Blockchain and Web 3 user interfaces sucks</h1>

            Web 3.0 (Web3) is the third generation of the evolution 
            of web technologies. The web, also known as the World Wide Web,
             is the foundational  layer for how the internet is used,
            providing website and application services.

        <pre>
 Crypto natives have been living and breathing Web3 for years. They populate an enormous
echo chamber of people speaking a language that most tech people can’t even understand,
  to say nothing of the general public.

I totally understand the sense of wonder and empowerment that comes from knowing you are building
 the future — that you know things only your fellow travelers truly understand,
  especially if some of these things will not only spell doom for what came before, but are going to change the world. 
  Early Web 2.0 inventors felt this same way and for the same reasons.

The beginning of Web 2.0 was a time of new paradigms, new economies, new financial metrics and all the rest.
 What could we possibly learn from prior software projects? And how could old-school retail or catalog possibly have 
 anything to teach us about building the web?

From that perspective, it makes no sense for Web3 founders to look to Web 2.0 practices for…well…anything.
 Breaking from old standards and valuing creativity is core to Web3 DNA: everything is a candidate for revolutionary redesign.
  If you’re a crypto native reinventing enormous stuff like trust, money and digital identity, why wouldn’t you reinvent 
  user experience and how we develop software? Why use old practices to invent something new.
