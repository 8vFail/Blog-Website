            Modern cloud infrastructure and cloud native applications are making software and app development not only faster – and 
            thus more responsive to rapidly-evolving market/customer demands – but much cheaper and less labor intensive.

 1. Cloud native applications are programs designed for a cloud computing environment.
 “Cloud native apps are designed and built to exploit the scale, elasticity, resiliency, and flexibility the cloud provides,”
  according to Oracle. Cloud native apps are built upon cloud-native architecture, 
  which is an environment made specifically to exist in the cloud, as opposed to on-premises infrastructure.     
  
  2. Cloud native services enable efficient software/app development using technologies such as
   Kubernetes, Docker, serverless functions, APIs, and Kafka. “Cloud providers enable cloud tooling and 
   services so developers can reduce operational tasks and build applications faster,” according to Oracle.
   Cloud native services give developers a comprehensive platform and menu of tools for building, deploying, 
  and managing cloud native applications.

   3. Containers are standard units of software that package up code (and all its dependencies) so the application
    runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A pre-packaged, pre-fabricated software container
    can be built for app X and then easily deployed for app Z. Containers are building blocks that support a “plug in and play” 
   approach to app development and deployment.

   4. Microservices, according to AWS, are “an architectural and organizational approach to software development where 
   software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.”

   5. Kubernetes, also referred to as K8 or K8s, is a “portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing 
    workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation,” says the Kubernetes website.
     It was open sourced by Google in 2014 and is managed by the vendor-neutral Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
      According to the CNCF,the number of developers using Kubernetes increased by 67% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Kubernetes 
   is the  platform that containers sit upon.
