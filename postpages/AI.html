            Should we be afraid of artificial intelligence? For me, this is a simple question with an even simpler, two letter answer: no. But not everyone agrees – many people, 
            including the late physicist Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns that the rise of powerful AI systems could spell the end for humanity.

 But let us demystify the most popular AI techniques, known collectively as “machine learning”.
  These allow a machine to learn a task without being programmed with explicit instructions.
  This may sound spooky but the truth is it is all down to some rather mundane statistics.
        
  The fact that AI is dubbed “intelligent” is ultimately down to the fact that it can learn.
 But even when it comes to learning, it is no match for humans. In fact, toddlers can learn by just watching 
  somebody solving a problem once. An AI, on the other hand, needs tonnes of data and loads of tries to succeed 
   on very specific problems, and it is difficult to generalise its knowledge on tasks very different to those trained upon. 
   So while humans develop breathtaking intelligence rapidly in the first few years of life,
   the key concepts behind machine learning are not so different from what they were one or two decades ago.

   Personally, I am more concerned by how humans use AI. Machine learning algorithms are often thought of as black boxes, 
   and less effort is made in pinpointing the specifics of the solution our algorithms have found. 
   This is an important and frequently neglected aspect as we are often obsessed with performance and less with understanding.
    Understanding the solutions that these systems have discovered is important, 
   because we can also evaluate if they are correct or desirable solutions.
